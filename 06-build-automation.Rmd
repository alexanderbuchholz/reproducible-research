# Build automation

Most research projects consist of several different connected components. For example, the end product might be a manuscipt, which depends on intermediate components such as a data analysis script and an R package. In this case, the manuscript depends on the data analysis script, which in turn depends on the R package. Such a hierarchy implies that every time a file changes, all files downstream in the hierarchy should be updated as well. In the previous example, we might adjust a function in the R package, which might change the outcome of the data analysis, and as a result, we'd have to re-run the data analysis script. The outcome of the data analysis might change the manuscript, so we'd have to re-compile that as well. In large projects, this quickly becomes very tedious and difficult to maintain by hand. Luckily there is software available to streamline this process.

## Data analysis pipeline

Consider the example from the previous section. The hierarchy of files may be represented as: r-package.tar.gz > analysis.R > manuscript.Rnw. A change higher up the hierarchy might change the downstream files. Ideally, we would like to have a command that re-runs/compiles the different files everytime an upstream change is made. In our example, we would like to recompile the manuscript.Rnw file if something in the analysis.R file changes. And similarilly, if the R package changes, the analysis.R file should be re-run. This is exactly what the GNU software Make does.
