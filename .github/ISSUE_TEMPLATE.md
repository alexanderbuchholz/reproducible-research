Please make sure to familiarize yourself with the following notes to keep the
issue board all shipshape!

* Be polite!
* Do cross-reference a lot: whenever applicable reference to a particular comit 
on master or the feature branch you are refering to, do reference source code 
lines to cite questionabl section (markdown be thanked these should be human readable ;) )
* For anything development-related: Try to immediately assign the appropriated 
labels and - if applicable - suggest a milestone. 
* Make sure to close your issues when the problem has been resolved.
* Asking questions about how to get something to work in an issue is perfectly fine -
after all, how to resolve these questions might be of interest to others!
Please just make sure to assign the label 'question' to separate these issues
from more development-related stuff.
