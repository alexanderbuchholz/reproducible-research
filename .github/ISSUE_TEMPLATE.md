# Issue template

please make sure to familiarize yourelf with the following notes to keep the
issue board all shipshape!


## Questions

In contrast to many other open source code projects using the issues board for
questions about how to get something to work is perfectly fine -
after all, how to resolve these questions might be of interest to others!
PLease jsut make sure to assign the label 'question' to separate these issues
from more development-related stuff.

## General

* Be polite!
* Do cross-reference a lot: whenever applicable reference to a particular comit 
on master or the feature branch you are refering to, do reference source code 
lines to cite questionabl section (markdown be thanked these should be human readable ;) )
* For anything development-related: Try to immediately assign the appropriated 
labels and - if applicable - suggest a milestone. 
* Make sure to close your issues when the problem has been resolved.
