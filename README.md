# A Living Reproducible Research Compendium


This is an interactive, 'living', bookdown (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) 
project to build a hands-on resource
for pragmatic solutions to reproducibility related issues in biostatistics.
The book itself acts a learning-by-doing example for its contributers and should 
be considered permanent WIP.
